# One Billion Row Challenge

Attempt on [Morling's challenge](https://www.morling.dev/blog/one-billion-row-challenge/).
The task is to write a Java program which reads the file, calculates the min, mean, and max temperature value per weather station, 
and emits the results on stdout like this (i.e. sorted alphabetically by station name, and the result values per station 
in the format `<min>/<mean>/<max>`, rounded to one fractional digit).
